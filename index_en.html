          <hr />
          <p><img src="images/uare_kalaks_logo.png">Iare Pekhit wants <i>YOU</i> to take part in the public art project “Uare Qalaqs” (Care for the City). Are you going to be 1 of the 5 winning artists to present your street installation in one of the five chosen public areas of Tbilisi?</p>
          <p>For our project, we are looking for artists, who can transform the given spaces and play with the way the inhabitants see and feel the city. Artists, who are able to drag the spectator out of their comfort zones and have them collaborate, initiate and develop new things together.</p>
          <p>We also love to walk and we want to encourage pedestrianism, show its role in our lives in an artistic, sharp, and preferably, poetic manner!</p>
          <p>In a city, where the needs of humans are not clearly articulated, voiced and defended, and officials do not have the tools to effectively listen and account, public space concerns are not addressed. The challenge is huge, but “Uare Qalaqs” is an engagement experiment, to open up channels of communication between the community, professionals and officials through public art!</p>
          <p>Public events, gatherings, protests or other activity will take place at each project opening around the theme proposed by the artist! It could be you!</p>
          <p>The project is implemented with the support of the UN Democracy Fund and The Tbilisi City Hall.</p>
